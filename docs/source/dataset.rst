Datasets
========================

Large datasets are the essential for the success of recent advances in human motion synthesis using deep learning. There are many different available datasets from humam motion captures: they may use different rigging and parameterization of the body. Here, we list the datasets which are support in `GenMotion` for training, testing and sampling animation.

`HDM05 <http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/HDM05/index.html>`_  contains more than three hours, more than 70 motion classes in 10 to 50 realizations executed by various actors of systematically recorded and well-documented motion capture data in the C3D as well as in the ASF/AMC data format.
